# Fix MySQL Access Denied & Port Issues

## 1. Check MySQL Service Status
- **Windows (XAMPP):** Open XAMPP and start MySQL.
- **Linux/macOS:** Run:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl start mysql  # or mariadb
  ```

## 2. Change MySQL Port (If Needed)
- Open `my.ini` (Windows) or `my.cnf` (Linux/macOS).
- Find:
  ```ini
  port=3306
  ```
- Change it to `3307` (or any available port):
  ```ini
  port=3307
  ```
- Restart MySQL.
- Update `config.inc.php`:
  ```php
  $cfg['Servers'][$i]['host'] = '127.0.0.1';
  $cfg['Servers'][$i]['port'] = '3307';
  ```

## 3. Fix MySQL Access Denied
### a) Reset Root Password
1. Stop MySQL:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl stop mysql
   ```
2. Start MySQL in safe mode:
   ```sh
   sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking &
   ```
3. Open MySQL:
   ```sh
   mysql -u root
   ```
4. Reset password:
   ```sql
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```
5. Restart MySQL:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl restart mysql
   ```

### b) Update `config.inc.php`
- If MySQL has a password:
  ```php
  $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user'] = 'root';
  $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'newpassword';
  ```

## 4. Allow Root Login Without Password (Optional)
- Change `config.inc.php`:
  ```php
  $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = true;
  ```
- Add in `my.cnf`:
  ```ini
  skip-grant-tables
  ```
- Restart MySQL.

## 5. Check Firewall & Open MySQL Port
- Check if MySQL port is open:
  ```sh
  netstat -tulnp | grep 3306
  ```
- Allow MySQL port:
  ```sh
  sudo ufw allow 3306/tcp
  ```

## 6. Restart Services
- Restart MySQL & Apache.
- Try accessing **phpMyAdmin** again.

### XAMPP Apache Port 80 Error

**Issue:**
- Apache fails to start due to Port 80 being already in use by another process with PID 4.
  
**Solution:**
1. **Identify Blocking Application:**
   - Port 80 is commonly used by services like Skype, IIS, or other applications.
   - Open **Task Manager** and look for the process with PID 4. This might be the system's HTTP service or another application using Port 80.

2. **Disable or Reconfigure the Blocking Application:**
   - **Skype:** Go to Skype settings > Advanced > Connection and uncheck "Use port 80 and 443 for incoming connections."
   - **IIS (Internet Information Services):** Disable IIS or stop the World Wide Web Publishing Service from the **Services** tab.

3. **Reconfigure Apache to Use a Different Port:**
   - Open the **httpd.conf** file in the XAMPP directory (`C:\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf`).
   - Change the line `Listen 80` to `Listen 8080` (or any other available port).
   - Change the line    `ServerName localhost:80` to `ServerName localhost:8080`.
   - Save and restart Apache.

**Note:** If you change the port, remember to update the XAMPP Control Panel and your browser's URL to `http://localhost:8080` (or your chosen port).

This should resolve the conflict and allow Apache to start successfully.
